I AM Affirmations Website Project

This is my first fully completed project. This project will aim to incorporate three key features for the user to interact with.

1. The user will be able to click a button and display affirmations that cycle through randomly.
2. The user can input their own affirmations.
3. The user can select a "theme" of their choosing which will change the background of the website.

If there is more time to continue to improve these features, I would like to add categories of affirmations where people can select a category of affirmations to display and cycle through. They can also add their own by category.
